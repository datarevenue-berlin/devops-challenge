# Datarevenue Code Challenge

Congratulations for making it to the Code Challenge. In this challenge the goal is to provision a docker container sucht that it is able to run a dask-cluster. This might sound complicated but it the challenge comes with a run configuration already. 
You only have to provision the docker container by implementing the dockerfile and run the bootstrap bash script. The solution can be expressed in as little as 5 lines.

This should be straightforward on all linux and osx systems. 

## Notes
- This should take you between 20-60 minutes
- Use python3
- The dockerfile should inherit from `ubuntu:16.04` 
- You are not allowed to change any files.
- execute bootstrap.sh and email us the output along with your solution.
