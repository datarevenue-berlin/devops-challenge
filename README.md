# Datarevenue Code Challenge

Congratulations for making it to the Code Challenge. In this challenge the goal is to provision a docker container sucht that it is able to run a dask-cluster. This might sound complicated but it the challenge comes with a run configuration already. 
You only have to provision the docker container by implementing the dockerfile and run the bootstrap bash script. 

This should be straightforward on all linux and osx systems. 

## Rules
- Implement dockerfile.
- The dockerfile should inherit from `ubuntu:16.04` 
- Use python3
- You are not allowed to change any files.
- execute bootstrap.sh and email us the output along with your code.
